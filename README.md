# Asteroids
Thank you to Alex Kim for composing the fabulous music. 
For my first attempt at making a game I made a version of asteroids
The game starts immediatly when the jar file is run. 
Download the Zip file if you only with to run the game, don't mess with the asteroids file because the music may not work if you do.
Scoring
    200 Points for small asteroids
    100 Points for medium asteroids 
    50 Points for large asterods 
    10 Points for every 33 frames survived. 
Controls
    Up: accelerates the ship
    Left and Right: steer the ship 
    There is NO reverse
    P: pause and unpause
    M: mute and unmute
    Y: restart game after game ends
    N: close game after game ends
Known Bugs:
    The bullets may phase through small asteroids because they are going too fast and in going from one frame too the next may skip over the asteroid.
